                <h2>Design Ethnography</h2>
                <p>This project aimed to understand <i><b>Ethnographic Design Approach</b></i> in the topic of <i>"The main meal from shopping to dish"</i> which detects human natural behavior by taking acount into <i>the four principals</i></p>:
                	<ol>
                		<li><u>Natural Behavior:</u></li>&nbps;Through fieldwork, you will be able to see their honest behavior.</li>
                		<li><u>Holism</u>&nbps;Instead of looking into specific aspects such as individual behavior, an overall situation (E.g., social influence, culture, and traditional) and people’s perspective as a whole would enhance the understanding of particular behavior.</li>
                		<li><u>Descriptive</u>&nbps;It is important to exclude any interpretations and assumptions during ethnography to comprehend how people actually behave.</li>
                		<li><u>Member’s Point-of-View</u>&nbps;thnography aims to obtain people’s insights and values which connect to the meanings of behind their behavior.</li>
                	</ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The initial research scoped to my final research topic: <i>" Meal Responsibilities in Cross-Cultural Relationship"</i>. I narrowed down the research target to couples and parents from different nationalities. The research revealed two insights to inspire designers to find solutions.</p>

		<p> <a name="Storyboard"></a></p>
		<h2>Storyboard</h2>		
		<p>Throughout the experience of using my idea, <i><b>Storyboard</b></i> helps me understand the user's storyline. In this project, I focused on entertaining people while being stuck in traffic. </p>
		<div id="wrap">
			<img class="left" src="images/storyboard1.jpg" alt="storyboard1">
			<img class="right" src="images/storyboard2.jpg" alt="storyboard1">

		<p>The storyboard, therefore, shows how do the users feel about the experience and what are the steps they would take in order to complete the idea. </p>

<!-- Whack Pack Evaluation -->

		<p> <a name="Whackoackcards"></a></p>
		<h2>Whack Pack Cards</h2>
		<p>Whack Pack Cards helps to discover another way of creative thinking by forcing making a connection between the idea and the cards. When I evaluated my idea, I picked up one of the cards <i>"Exaggerate"</i> which implies how the idea can expand the potential.</p>
		<div class ="whackpack">

		<p> This card made me step back to the ideation phase. Instead of having a simple immersive audiobook, I added a game function that people can choose a story's path by voting among the members.</p>
