                <h2>Design Ethnography</h2>
                <p>This project aimed to understand <i><b>Ethnographic Design Approach</b></i> in the topic of <i>"The main meal from shopping to dish"</i> which detects human natural behavior by taking acount into <i>the four principals</i>:</p>
                	<ol>
                		<li><u>Natural Behavior:</u></li>
                		Through fieldwork, you will be able to see their honest behavior.
                		<li><u>Holism</u></li>
                		Instead of looking into specific aspects such as individual behavior, an overall situation (E.g., social influence, culture, and traditional) and people’s perspective as a whole would enhance the understanding of particular behavior.
                		<li><u>Descriptive</u></li>
                		It is important to exclude any interpretations and assumptions during ethnography to comprehend how people actually behave.
                		<li><u>Member’s Point-of-View</u></li>
                		Ethnography aims to obtain people’s insights and values which connect to the meanings of behind their behavior.
                	</ol>

                <p>The initial research scoped to my final research topic: <i>" Meal Responsibilities in Cross-Cultural Relationship"</i>. I narrowed down the research target to couples and parents from different nationalities. The research revealed two insights to inspire designers to find solutions.</p>

			<h2>Legi&Finn</h2>
			<p>The first insight was when people from the outside their country, they miss their home food and also tradition. Buying those ingredients or going to a restaurant costs more than buying local food. </p>

				<p>[Persona's Insight]</p>
				<br>
				<p>Legi is from Indonesia being in a relationship with a Dutch boyfriend. When she misses her family and friend in Indonesia, she tries to distract herself by eating home food so that she doesn't feel homesickness. Her boyfriend Lucas understood her situation but he cannot keep eating only Indonesian food. Also, he tried to cheer her up by going to an Indonesian restaurant, but it didn't last for long due to their budget.</p>
				<p>What she could try to improve her situation was to find other indonesian people who are in a similar situation so that she could share her feelings. She also hopes if they are interested in buying indonesian food together.</p>
				<br>

			<h2>Emila&Lucas</h2>		
			<p>The second insight was a communication conflict in sharing meal activities such as meal preparation, cleaning, and food shopping. Especially, for the couples who are from both high and low context communication style, they seemed to have a difficulty in conveying their honest opinion. This influence makes them feel frustrated since this is something they cannot avoid. </p>

					<p>[Persona's Insight]</p>
					<br>
					<p>Emila is a Brazilian woman who is working as a full-time job in the Netherlands. She lives together with her Dutch fiance Lucas for almost two years. They both work during the daytime, but preparing meal (dinner) is Emila's responsibility since she once said she liked cooking. One day, when she came home after a stressful workday, she was too tired to cook. Lucas was already home but he was just sitting on the couch and waiting for dinner. Emila tried to ask for some help but she was not able to do so because it scares her to be rude. </p>
					<p>She decided to tell her honest feeling but wishes if there is something that she can share daily activities without making both her and Lucas annoying.
