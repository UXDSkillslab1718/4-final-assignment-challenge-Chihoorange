                <h2>Holographic Audiobook</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to find valuable solutions for reducing the boredom of waiting time during a trip. My final idea was <i><b>Holographic Audiobook</b></i>which designed for people stuck in traffic. This is an audiobook application which provides an immersive experience in the user's car. Eeach passengers' smartphone works as a speaker so that they can have multiple audio channels.
                <br>
                <br>
                The projects went through ideation, prototyping, and evaluation by applying the three techniques.

<!-- Mindmap -->
		<div class="content-wrap">
		<p> <a name="Mindmap"></a></p>
		<h2>Mindmap</h2>
		<p>I draw up <i><b>Mindmap</b></i> to see the incolvements of the topoc. I devided into four main sections which are:</p>
		<div class ="mindmap">
				<img src="images/mindmap1.jpg" alt="mindmap">
			</div>
		<ol>
			<li> Location <i>"Where do people wait?"</i></li>
			<li> Emotion <i>"What do people feel?</i></li>
			<li> Action <i>"How do people wait?</i></li>
			<li> Tools <i>"What tooks do people use?</i></li>
		</ol>
		<p>This ideation technique allows me to understand the relationshop around the main topic as an initial step of the design research.</p>
		</div>
<!-- Storyboard -->
		<div class="content-wrap">
		<p> <a name="Storyboard"></a></p>
		<h2>Storyboard</h2>		
		<p>Throughout the experience of using my idea, <i><b>Storyboard</b></i> helps me understand the user's storyline. In this project, I focused on entertaining people while being stuck in traffic. </p>
		<div id="wrap">
			<img class="left" src="images/storyboard1.jpg" alt="storyboard1">
			<img class="right" src="images/storyboard2.jpg" alt="storyboard1">
			</div>
		<p>The storyboard, therefore, shows how do the users feel about the experience and what are the steps they would take in order to complete the idea. </p>
		</div>
<!-- Whack Pack Evaluation -->
		<div class="content-wrap">
		<p> <a name="Whackoackcards"></a></p>
		<h2>Whack Pack Cards</h2>
		<p>Whack Pack Cards helps to discover another way of creative thinking by forcing making a connection between the idea and the cards. When I evaluated my idea, I picked up one of the cards <i>"Exaggerate"</i> which implies how the idea can expand the potential.</p>
		<div class ="whackpack">
				<img src="images/whackpack.jpg" alt="Whack Pack Cards">
			</div>
		<p> This card made me step back to the ideation phase. Instead of having a simple immersive audiobook, I added a game function that people can choose a story's path by voting among the members.</p>
