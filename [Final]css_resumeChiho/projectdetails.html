		<h2>Mindmap</h2>
		<p>The topic of this project was to thihk up new ideas for reducing frustration while wating for transportation such as train and bus. I used <i><b>Mindmap</b></i> to generalize the topic. I devided into four main sections which are</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Location <i>"Where do people wait?"</i></li>
			<li> Emotion <i>"What do people feel?</i></li>
			<li> Action <i>"How do people wait?</i></li>
			<li> Tools <i>"What tooks do people use?</i></li>
		</ol>
		<p>This ideation technique allows me to understand the involvements around the main topic as the initial step of the design research.</p>

		<h2>Storyboard</h2>
		<p>Throughout the experience of using my idea, <i><b>Storyboard</b></i> helps me understand the user's storyline. In this project, I focused on entertaining people while being stuck in traffic. As most people possess a smartphone, I came up with an audiobook application which each smartphone works as a speaker so that they can have multiple audio channels. This allows having an immersive experience.</p>
		<p>The storyboard, therefore, shows how do the users feel about the experience and what are the steps they would take in order to complete the idea. </p>
