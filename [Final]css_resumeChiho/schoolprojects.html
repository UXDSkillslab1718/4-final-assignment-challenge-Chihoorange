				<h3>Mindmap</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="column-wide description">
			<p>This technique starts by drawing up the knowledge you already know by categorizing into sections in order to comprehend a broad view of your target field.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column-narrow">
            	<h3>Storyboard</h3>
            </div>
            	<div class="column-wide description">
            	<p>This technique helps to understand a user's point of view. By making a storyline, this allows picturing what the user would think and feel so that you can cover their needs and steps they need to take account into. </p>

            	<h3>Whack Whack Card Evaluation</h3>
            </div>
            	<div class="column-wide description">
            	<p>When your idea comes to an evaluation step, this technique implies another way of thinking. By using these cards, it would help you to see how you could improve your idea.</p>

			<h2>Research for Design</h2>
			<p>The ethnographic design approach applied in this project to detect users' needs. Through interviews, observation, and reading research, I was allowed to create two personas so that I can convey insightful information to designers.</p>
			<p><a href="projectdetails2.html">See more details>></a></p>

				<h3>Ethnoglaphic Interview</h3>
			</div>
				<div class="column-wide description">
			<p>This design approach focuses on users' natural behavior. Thus, the interview was semi-structured in order to make my participants feel not interrogated because that would influence their naturalistic point of view.</p>
                </div>
            <div class="column-narrow">
				<h3>Observation</h3>
			</div>
				<div class="column-wide description">
			<p>Instead of hearing their point of view, observation would help understand their natural bahvior. </p>
                </div>
            <div class="column-narrow">
				<h3>Reading Activity</h3>
			</div>
				<div class="column-wide description">
			<p>Reading Activity might be a good start for looking at your users; need and context. Any reading sources including news, blogs, magazines, and scientific literature are helpful to identify the users' insights.</p>
