			<h2>Design & Creativity</h2>
			<p>The main purpose of this project was to visualize ideas by obtaining a variety of ideation techniques, such as mindmap, storyboard, and whack pack card evaluation.</p>
			<p>See more details <a href="projectdetails.html">>></a>.</p>

				<h3>Mindmap</h3>
			<p>This technique starts by drawing up the knowledge you already know by categorizing into sections in order to comprehend a broad view of your target field.</p>
			
                </div>
            <div class="column-wide technique-description">
            	<h3>Storyboard</h3>
            	<p>This technique helps to understand a user's point of view. By making a storyline, this allows picturing what the user would think and feel so that you can cover their needs and steps they need to take account into. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column-wide technique-description">
            	<h3>Whack Ppack Card Evaluation</h3>
            	<p>When your idea comes to an evaluation step, this technique implies another way of thinking. By using these cards, it would help you to see how you could improve your idea.</p>

			<h2>Research for Design</h2>
			<p>The ethnographic design approach applied in this project to detect users' needs. Through interviews, observation, and reading research, I was allowed to create two personas so that I can convey insightful information to designers.</p>
			<p>See more details <a href="projectdetails.html">>></a>.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="column-wide research-description">
				<h3>Ethnoglaphic Interview</h3>
			<p>This design approach focuses on users' natural behavior. Thus, the interview was semi-structured in order to make my participants feel not interrogated because that would influence their naturalistic point of view.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column-wide research-description">
				<h3>Observation</h3>
			<p>Instead of hearing their point of view, observation would help understand their natural bahvior. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column-wide research-description">
				<h3>Reading Activity</h3>
			<p>Reading Activity might be a good start for looking at your users; need and context. Any reading sources including news, blogs, magazines, and scientific literature are helpful to identify the users' insights.</p>
